The Linux Operating System is a type of operating system that is similar to Unix, and it is built upon the Linux Kernel.
The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources.

Creating folders and files


mkdir /tmp/tutorial
cd /tmp/tutorial

mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3

mkdir -p dir4/dir5/dir6
ls



-p create the parent directories

ls > output.txt
cat output.txt

echo "This is a test"

echo "This is a test" > test_1.txt

cat test_1.txt test_2.txt test_3.txt

cat test_*

cat t* > combined.txt

cat combined.txt


cat t* >> combined.txt
echo "I've appended a line!" >> combined.txt
cat combined.txt

Moving and manipulating files

mv combined.txt dir1
ls dir1

mv dir1/* .

The mv command also lets us move more than one file at a time. If you pass more than two arguments, the last one is taken to be the destination directory and the others are considered to be files (or directories) to move.

mv combined.txt test_* dir3 dir2
ls
ls dir2

mv dir2/combined.txt dir4/dir5/dir6
ls dir2
ls dir4/dir5/dir6


cp dir4/dir5/dir6/combined.txt .
ls dir4/dir5/dir6
ls

cp combined.txt backup_combined.txt
ls

mv backup_combined.txt combined_backup.txt
ls

mv "folder 1" folder_1
mv "folder 2" folder_2


Deleting files and folders

rm dir4/dir5/dir6/combined.txt combined_backup.txt
rmdir will only delete empty folders.


rmdir folder_*

rm -r folder_6
ls

Word Count (-l only line count)

wc -l combined.txt


ls ~ > file_list.txt
wc -l file_list.txt
rm file_list.txt

ls ~ | wc -l

cat combined.txt | uniq | wc -l # count unique lines

sort combined.txt | less


The command line and the superuser

sudo apt install tree

Hidden files - are commonly used on Linux systems to store settings and configuration data, and are typically hidden simply so that they donâ€™t clutter the view of your own file


cd /tmp/tutorial
ls
mv combined.txt .combined.txt
ls

You can still work with the hidden file by making sure you include the dot when you specify its file name:

cat .combined.txt
mkdir .hidden
mv .combined.txt .hidden
less .hidden/.combined.txt

ls
ls -a
ls .hidden
ls -a .hidden

Grep - Grep stands for Global regular expression print. As the name implies, Grep is used to search text files with regular expressions (shortly regex).


$ cat file.txt
ostechnix
Ostechnix
o$technix
linux
linus
unix
technology
hello world
HELLO world

$ grep nix file.txt

$ grep 'hello world' file.txt 

$ grep -n nix file.txt

$ grep os file.txt 

$ grep -i os file.txt  # -i ignore case sensitive


$ cat file.txt | grep os

We can also use some special characters or regular expressions in grep.

^ - search at the beginning of the line.
$ - search at the end of the line.
. - Search any character.


$ grep tech file.txt

$ grep ^tech file.txt

$ grep ^tech file.txt

$ grep x$ file.txt

search for any word that has "n" in the file.
$ grep .n file.txt

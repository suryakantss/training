Create a class  BankAccount having the members as given below:
accNo	integer
custName string
accType string (indicates ‘Savings’ or ‘Current’)
balance float

Include the following methods in the BankAccount class:
void deposit(float amt);
void withdraw(float amt);
float getBalance();
 	
deposit(float amt) method allows you to credit an amount into the current balance. 
If amount is negative, throw an exception NegativeAmountException to block the operation from 
being performed.

withdraw(float amt) method allows you to debit an amount from the current balance. 
Please ensure a minimum balance of Rs. 1000/- in the account for savings account 
and Rs. 5000/- for current account, else throw an exception InsufficientFundsException 
and block the withdrawal operation. 

Also throw an exception NegativeAmountException to block the operation from being 
performed if the amt parameter passed to this method is negative.

getBalance() method returns the current balance. If the current balance 
is below the minimum required balance, then throw an exception LowBalanceException accordingly.

Have constructor to which you will pass, accno, cust_name, acctype and initial balance. 
And check whether the balance is less than 1000 or not in case of savings account and less than 5000 in case of a current account. If so, then raise a LowBalanceException. 
In either case if the balance is negative then raise the NegativeAmountException exception accordingly.
